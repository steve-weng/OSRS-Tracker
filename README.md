# OSRS-Tracker

itemID.py is for updating the item ID table from the Runelite API.  It saves the data to a pickle file.  It's unnecessary to update this unless there is an update to item IDs you are interested in.  Also requires the Runelite API to still be functional, but you can mess around with it as needed.
